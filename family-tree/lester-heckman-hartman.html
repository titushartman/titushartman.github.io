Lester Heckman HARTMAN was an uncle of Titus HARTMAN and a twin brother of Chester Heckman HARTMAN. He was married to Minnie Yoder MERKEL (1887-1975), and they had no children.<br><br>
During the 1970s, Minnie's brother Herbert Leroy MERKEL (1900-1985) lived with Lester and Minnie at West Philadelphia Avenue in Boyertown, PA. Herbert had been blinded in a childhood accident: while playing in a field, he fell into a cornstalk and was blinded in one eye. The resulting infection took his vision in the other eye as well. Herbert continued to live with Lester after Minnie's death in 1975.<br><br>
Lester and Minnie are buried together at Fairview Cemetery in Boyertown, PA.<br><br>
